### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

1. **Grid Layout Stacking Issue**: The two columns were stacking vertically instead of displaying side-by-side
   - **Problem**: Had a comma between grid column values: `grid-template-columns: 40%, 60%`
   - **Solution**: Removed the comma to use correct syntax: `grid-template-columns: 40% 60%`
   - **Learning**: CSS Grid column values should be space-separated, not comma-separated

2. **Missing Colon in :root**: CSS variables weren't working initially
   - **Problem**: Wrote `root {` instead of `:root {`
   - **Solution**: Added colon before `root` to properly define CSS custom properties
   - **Learning**: CSS pseudo-classes require a colon prefix

3. **Button Hover Not Working**: Hover state wasn't applying to the submit button
   - **Problem**: Had a space in the selector: `button [type="submit"]`
   - **Solution**: Removed space: `button[type="submit"]`
   - **Learning**: Attribute selectors must be attached directly to the element with no space

4. **Invalid Display Property**: Had `display: grid;` inside the `:root` block
   - **Problem**: Display properties don't belong in CSS variable declarations
   - **Solution**: Removed the invalid property from `:root` and placed grid on body element
   - **Learning**: `:root` is only for defining CSS custom properties (variables)

5. **Spacing Syntax Errors**: Multiple spacing issues with units
   - **Problem**: Had spaces between numbers and units: `1.25 rem`, `42 rem`
   - **Solution**: Removed spaces: `1.25rem`, `42rem`
   - **Learning**: CSS units must be written without spaces between value and unit

6. **Typo in Variable Names**: Some CSS variables had typos
   - **Problem**: `--front-weight-semibold` instead of `--font-weight-semibold`, `--text-placehodler` instead of `--text-placeholder`
   - **Solution**: Carefully checked and corrected all variable names
   - **Learning**: Variable typos cause properties to not apply; double-check spelling

7. **Focus Selector Spacing**: Input focus states weren't working
   - **Problem**: Had space before `:focus`: `input[type="email"] :focus`
   - **Solution**: Removed space: `input[type="email"]:focus`
   - **Learning**: Pseudo-class selectors must be attached directly without spaces

8. **Paragraph Line Breaks**: Text wasn't breaking at the correct points to match design
   - **Problem**: Natural text wrapping didn't match the reference image
   - **Solution**: Added `<br>` tags at specific points in the paragraph
   - **Learning**: Sometimes manual line breaks are needed to match specific designs
